## Task 1 - Hubert Dębowski
Python
Matlab

## Task 3: Classification Accuracy - Tymoteusz Maj

### Overview
In this task, I performed Sentinel-2 classification using the K-Means algorithm (or any relevant tool) and downloaded the Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) map, such as Urban Atlas or Corine. The accuracy analysis was conducted using [this repository](https://github.com/RemoteSys/accuracy).

### Code Implementation
At the beginning of the work, I created a code in Google Earth Engine (GEE) that processes both the LULC and Sentinel-2 images. Unfortunately, the process took over 20 minutes, and the screen was accidentally removed by another person.

All the code used to retrieve the data was stored in the appropriate folder.

### Library Installation
Next, I installed the required library from the repository to support the project.

### Python Code Execution
I then created a Python script that executes the necessary command.

### Final Result
After running the process, I obtained the following result:
