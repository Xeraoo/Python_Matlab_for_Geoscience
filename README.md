TASK 3

Classification accuracy
perform Sentinel-2 classification - K-Means any tool
download LULC map (i.e. Urban Atlas or Corine)
perform accuracy analysis using https://github.com/RemoteSys/accuracy


At the beginning of Task 3, we created code in GEE that retrieves a SENTINEL 2 image and a LULC image for the area we selected. The area was selected as GZM and we created code in GEE that retrieves the data

I then wrote code in Python executing the contents of task 3
